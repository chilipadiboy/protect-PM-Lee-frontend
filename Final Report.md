In your final demo, you will demonstrate the final system behaviour, and make claims about attacks on your subsystem (what parts you think are safe). A report should be submitted by Friday 2nd of November, detailing the elements and technical elements of the final project subsystems, along with any claims you can make about itâ€™s security behaviour. At this time your source code will be released to the other team members. In addition, at this time you will briefly demonstrate your system (the user interface, general operation, and so on) to the other team during that week.
